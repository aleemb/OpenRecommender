ALGORITHM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithms and programming logic to implement the OpenRecommender Recommendation Engine.

 http://openrecommender.org/algorithm/


This is where connections are made to a customized version of the Apache Mahout project's Java-based Recommendation Engine.

It also includes Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) scripts to implement useful algorithms for aggregating, sorting, ranking and filtering data then presenting that data on the World Wide Web (WWW) or exporting that data as JSON, XML and RDF to be consumed by any number of other platforms, programs or devices capable of reading those formats.

There are no further legal limitations placed on platforms, programs or devices who consume the data exported by the algorithms contained herein, so long as they are run on a separate server, using separate network resources; however, the author reserves the right to limit access to the version of these scripts running on the author's own servers and network resources.

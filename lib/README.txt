LIB

Libraries and programming logic to obtain data to power the OpenRecommender Recommendation Engine.

 http://openrecommender.org/lib/


This is where connections are made to external Web Services, Data Providers or Content Publishers.

It also includes Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) scripts to implement useful algorithms for retrieving, importing and parsing data then presenting that data on the World Wide Web (WWW) or exporting that data as JSON, XML and RDF to be consumed by any number of other platforms, programs or devices capable of reading those formats.

There are strict legal limitations placed on platforms, programs or devices who consume the data exported by the algorithms contained herein, even if they are run on a separate server, using separate network resources. It is critical to adhere to the access policies, privacy policies and legal terms of use of the Web Services, Data Providers and Content Publishers from whose servers and network resources the data is drawn. In many cases, access attempts to the data will not even be successful unless an API Key, Account or Authorization tokens are first obtained from the Web Services, Data Providers or Content Publishers from whose servers and network resources the data is drawn.

* What is this?
------------------------------------------------------
MicroFormatsParser is a package for extracting the microformats data
embedded into HTML. The gathered data is stored as an xArray of objects - 
one for each MicroFormat type container found.

You can find out more about microformats here:
http://microformats.org/


* What can I do with this?
------------------------------------------------------
You can extract hcards, hcalendars, hreviews and various "rel" elements 
(tags, bookmarks, permalinks...) from the existing HTML documents. Then
you can use the gathered data in your scripts.


* What do I need to run this?
------------------------------------------------------
1) PHP 4+; 
2) DOM XML extension 
3) xArray library package (get it at http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/3565.html)


* How do I use this?
------------------------------------------------------
Check the examples in "example" directory. You can also take a look at 
comments in the source, or run doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) over 
it to get a more readable documentation.
